    <h2>Exam advice</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Always bring a <mark>Highlighter</mark>, it's imporant to <mark>Highlight</mark> the <mark>important information.</mark>
    This rule is to make sure you read it properly, you can always <u>underline</U> instead. You may think of course I don't need to, you do, you may only lose a few marks but a few marks here and there make a grade,
    the amount of times ive misread the question and seen an L turn into a 1, a 69 to 96 and 5mA to 5A is unbelivable! All solved with the simple highlighter.<mark>But don't do this clearly this is useless!</mark>
      </li>
      <li>
        Never leave a question blank, you can always scrape a few marks by just trying, however if you're stuck and don't know leave it, and return to it later. This feeds into 4.
      </li>
      <li>Read the entire paper, you're sometimes given hints on other questions that can help you answer them(if you don't know already).
      </li>
      <li> Time management
      </li>
      </P>
